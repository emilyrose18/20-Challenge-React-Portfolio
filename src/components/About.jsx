            Hello, I'm Emily! I'm a New York based software engineer, currently building more applications to add to my porfolio. I love combining computer science and creative design to make an eye catching accessible, and user-friendly websites and applications.

          <p>
              Currently I am in my second year of college majoring in computer science. I learned python, and am currenly learning C++. I am also enrolled in a 24 week Columbia Bootcamp for web development. There I've mastered javascript, html, and css. It also helped me get familiar with the frontend and backend of web developing.
